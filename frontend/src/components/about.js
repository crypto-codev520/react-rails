        <p>I began my software journey March 15, 2020. This is the day Michigan was shut down by Covid. It started as a hobby and soon grew into a passion.</p>
        <p>On July 27th, 2020 I began my first day at Flatiron School.</p>
        <p>This Blog site is my final project at Flatiron. It is built with React-Redux for the front end, and Ruby-On-Rails for the back end.</p>
